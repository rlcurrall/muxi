# Muxi

A simple multiplexer driven off configuration.

You probably want tmux or zellij, but this is a fun tool.


## Motivation

I was working on an older project that required running 3 different commands to
start the application to develop and test locally. There are plenty of options
to address this issue, but I wanted to have something I could just add as an
NPM dependency and add a simple config file and an NPM script that would run
all the necessary commands in a easier to consume way.


## Goals

- [x] Linux support
- [ ] Windows support
